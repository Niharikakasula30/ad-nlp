The titers for *Salmonella Paratyphi* \"AH\" and \"BH\" were within the normal range.

A diagnosis requires clinical evaluation by a physician considering the patient's symptoms, medical history, and these lab results in context.  The slightly elevated ESR could indicate inflammation but needs further investigation.  The other results are largely within normal ranges.\n",
